# MERN and React Projects

Welcome to my collection of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and simple React projects. Below are various web applications that I’ve developed, showcasing different features like API interaction, real-time communication, file storage, game development, and more. All the front-end parts are hosted on GitHub Pages, while the backend API is hosted on Glitch (Note: First load might be slower due to Glitch’s inactivity timeout).
